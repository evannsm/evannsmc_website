A collection of open-source tools developed through my research at Georgia Tech's FACTS Lab and beyond — from academic document tooling to flight controllers deployed on real hardware. If any of these are useful to your work, a ⭐ on GitHub goes a long way.

## QuartoCV

**A modular, build-system-driven CV and resume template for academics.**

If you've ever spent more time fighting LaTeX than writing about your research, QuartoCV is for you. It combines Quarto's literate programming model with a smart GNU Make build system that tracks which source sections changed and rebuilds only the affected PDFs — so editing a single shared section automatically propagates across every document that includes it.

The template ships with two distinct style variants and three ready-to-use example documents:

- **Academic style** — two-column compact layout with bold section labels, 8pt typography, and tight spacing optimized for fitting a lot onto a page cleanly
- **Consulting style** — single-column standard margins with centered headers for a cleaner, more modern look

**Key features:**

- Modular `sections/` directory — edit one `.qmd` file, every CV that includes it rebuilds automatically
- Intelligent incremental builds via Makefile dependency tracking
- XeLaTeX engine for publication-quality typographic output
- Easily customizable fonts, margins, and spacing through YAML front matter

**Built with:** Quarto · XeLaTeX · GNU Make

## Motion Capture → PX4 Pipelines {#mocap4px4}

**Production-ready ROS 2 packages for indoor quadrotor experiments with Vicon and OptiTrack.**

Running indoor flight experiments means solving the same infrastructure problem every time: get your motion-capture system's position data into the drone's state estimator. These two companion packages handle all of it — coordinate frame conversion, EKF fusion, and full-state relay — so you can focus on your controller, not the plumbing.

**Vicon4PX4** connects to Vicon Tracker via the DataStream SDK (fully vendored — no system install needed), while **OptiTrack4PX4** connects to OptiTrack Motive via the NatNet protocol. Both packages share the same architecture and interface:

- ENU (East-North-Up) → NED (North-East-Down) coordinate conversion
- Pose data published as both quaternions and Euler angles
- `VehicleOdometry` messages for direct PX4 EKF external vision fusion
- Optional full-state relay merging fused EKF outputs into a single topic for logging and control

Three launch modes let you run exactly what you need: motion-capture client only, client + visual odometry relay, or all nodes including the full-state merger.

Vicon4PX4 has been adopted and showcased by Georgia Tech's Indoor Flight Lab as part of its official codebase.

## Newton-Raphson Flow for PX4

**A research-grade quadrotor controller backed by three peer-reviewed papers.**

NR Flow reframes trajectory tracking as an optimization problem solved at each timestep by the Newton-Raphson method — yielding fast, accurate control that is more computationally efficient than NMPC while matching or exceeding its tracking performance. The result: a controller that runs comfortably on a Raspberry Pi 4 onboard a real quadrotor.

Integral Control Barrier Functions (I-CBFs) are baked in to handle actuation limits without discontinuous switching, and all computations are JAX JIT-compiled for real-time deployment.

**Key features:**

- Newton-Raphson iterative Jacobian inversion for feedback linearization
- Integral CBF safety constraints on actuator inputs (enabled by default, configurable)
- JAX JIT-compilation for real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware
- Structured CLI for simulation and hardware deployment across multiple trajectory types
- Optional CSV logging with automatic analysis notebook generation
- Demonstrated on a Holybro X500V2 + Raspberry Pi 4

**Academic foundation:**

| Venue | Year |
|---|---|
| American Control Conference (ACC) | 2024 |
| IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (TCST) | 2025 |
| IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO) | 2025 |

## NMPC Acados PX4

**A production-ready Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller for quadrotors.**

:::

This package implements a 9-state NMPC using the Acados solver with QPOASES — a rigorous, well-understood approach that was used as the primary comparison baseline for the Newton-Raphson Flow work. If you need a solid NMPC reference implementation for your own quadrotor research, this is a clean starting point.

The controller tracks position, velocity, and Euler angles jointly with a configurable error-based cost formulation, wrapped yaw error handling to avoid angle discontinuities, and hard input constraints on thrust and body rates. C-code is generated by Acados for real-time computation.

**Key features:**

- 9-dimensional state tracking (position, velocity, Euler angles)
- Configurable stage and terminal cost weighting matrices
- Hard input constraints on thrust and body rates
- Wrapped yaw error handling via atan2
- Multiple built-in trajectory types: figure-8, circle, helix, hover
- Optional CSV data logging
- Clean ROS 2 node interface with `--platform {sim,hw}` flag

**Built with:** Python · Acados · QPOASES · ROS 2 · PX4
