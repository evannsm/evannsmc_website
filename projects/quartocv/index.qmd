**A modular, build-system-driven CV and Résumé template for academics.**

If you've ever spent more time fighting LaTeX than writing about your research, QuartoCV is for you. It combines Quarto's literate programming model with a smart GNU Make build system that tracks which source sections changed and rebuilds only the affected PDFs — so editing a single shared section automatically propagates across every document that includes it.

The template ships with two distinct style variants and three ready-to-use example documents:

- **Academic style** — two-column compact layout with bold section labels, 8pt typography, and tight spacing optimized for fitting a lot onto a page cleanly
- **Consulting style** — single-column standard margins with centered headers for a cleaner, more modern look

**Key features:**

- Modular `sections/` directory — edit one `.qmd` file, every CV that includes it rebuilds automatically
- Intelligent incremental builds via Makefile dependency tracking
- XeLaTeX engine for publication-quality typographic output
- Easily customizable fonts, margins, and spacing through YAML front matter

**Built with:** Quarto · XeLaTeX · GNU Make
