## What This Post Covers

This is another example post! Notice how each post is in its own folder within `blog/posts/`.

The beauty of the Kalman filter is...

## Why Folders for Each Post?

Having each post in its own folder (`blog/posts/post-name/index.qmd`) allows you to:

1. **Keep images with the post** - Just drop images in the same folder
2. **Organize related files** - Data files, notebooks, etc.
3. **Easy to manage** - Each post is self-contained

## The YAML Frontmatter

At the top of this file, the YAML frontmatter between `---` marks contains:

- **title**: The post title (appears as heading and in listings)
- **description**: Short summary (appears in the blog listing page)
- **author**: Your name
- **date**: Publication date (used for sorting)
- **categories**: Tags for filtering posts
- **image**: Optional featured image (if you add one to this folder)
- **draft: true**: This marks the post as a draft (won't appear on your site until you change to `draft: false` or remove this line)

## Next Steps

When you're ready to write your first real post:

1. Create a new folder in `blog/posts/` like `blog/posts/2025-01-25-your-topic/`
2. Copy this file as a template
3. Update the YAML frontmatter
4. Write your content
5. Set `draft: false` when ready to publish
6. Run `quarto render` to build your site
