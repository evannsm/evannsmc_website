## Introduction

This is an example blog post to demonstrate the structure. When you write your actual posts, you can use this template!

PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers are fundamental to control systems. In this post, I'll explain...

## The Proportional Term

The proportional term responds to the current error. Imagine you're trying to balance a robot...

## Key Takeaways

- Write your content here
- You can use markdown formatting
- Images, equations, code blocks all work

## Mathematical Expressions

Quarto supports LaTeX math. For example:

$$
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
$$

## Code Examples

```python
def pid_controller(error, integral, derivative, kp, ki, kd):
    """Simple PID controller implementation"""
    output = kp * error + ki * integral + kd * derivative
    return output
```
