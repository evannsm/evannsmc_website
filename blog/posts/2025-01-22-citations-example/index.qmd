## Overview

This post demonstrates how to cite academic papers in your Quarto blog posts, just like you would in LaTeX! All you need is a `.bib` file in the same folder as your post.

## How It Works

1. **Create a `.bib` file** in your post folder (e.g., `references.bib`)
2. **Add `bibliography: references.bib`** to your YAML frontmatter
3. **Use citation syntax** like `[@kalman1960]` in your text
4. **The bibliography is automatically generated** at the end!

## Citation Examples

### Basic Citation

The Kalman filter revolutionized state estimation [@kalman1960]. This creates a citation in parentheses.

### Multiple Citations

Many excellent textbooks cover feedback control [@astrom2008; @lynch2017]. Use semicolons to separate multiple citations.

### In-Text Citation

@boyd2004 provide a comprehensive treatment of convex optimization. This puts the author names directly in the sentence.

### Citation with Page Numbers

The configuration space approach is discussed in detail [@lavalle2006, pp. 123-145].

### Suppressing Author Names

The LQR-trees algorithm [-@tedrake2010] uses sums-of-squares verification. The `-` suppresses the author names but keeps the year.

### Multiple References Together

Modern approaches to motion planning combine optimization and control theory [@lavalle2006; @tedrake2010; @lynch2017].

## Practical Example

Let's discuss a real topic with citations. The foundations of modern control theory were established by the development of optimal filtering [@kalman1960]. This work, along with @astrom2008's accessible treatment of feedback systems, provides the theoretical basis for many robotic applications.

When implementing controllers for robotic manipulators, @lynch2017 offer practical algorithms that build on classical control theory [@astrom2008]. For path planning, @lavalle2006 provides comprehensive coverage of the configuration space approach.

## Citation Styles

Notice the `csl:` field in the YAML frontmatter? This controls the citation style:

- **IEEE** (currently used): `csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/ieee`
- **APA**: `csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa`
- **Chicago**: `csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-author-date`
- **Nature**: `csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/nature`

You can find thousands of styles at [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

## Where Do You Get `.bib` Entries?

Most places you find papers have BibTeX export:

- **Google Scholar**: Click the quote icon → "BibTeX"
- **arXiv**: Click "Export BibTeX Citation"
- **Conference/Journal websites**: Usually have a "Cite" or "Export" button
- **Zotero/Mendeley**: Export your library as `.bib`

## Summary

The citation syntax is identical to LaTeX:

| Syntax | Output |
|--------|--------|
| `[@kalman1960]` | [1] |
| `@kalman1960` | Kalman [1] |
| `[-@kalman1960]` | [1] (no author) |
| `[@kalman1960; @boyd2004]` | [1], [2] |
| `[@kalman1960, p. 42]` | [1, p. 42] |

The references section is automatically added below!
