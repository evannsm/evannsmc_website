    "text": "The Continuous-Time (Fluid-Flow) Formulation for Memoryless Plants\nTo transition this idea into a continuous-time control strategy, we first consider a simple case: a memoryless nonlinearity plant where the output \\(y(t)\\) is algebraically related to the input \\(u(t)\\) by \\(y(t) = g(u(t))\\).\nThe control objective (tracking) is to solve the time-dependent system of equations \\(r(t) - g(u) = 0\\). The iterative tracking algorithm is restructured to drive the error \\(r - y\\) to zero.\nBy defining the time step \\(\\Delta t\\), scaling the step size by \\(\\Delta t\\), and taking the limit as \\(\\Delta t \\to 0\\), the discrete iterative algorithm yields its continuous-time, fluid-flow variant that defines the rate of change of the control input \\(\\dot{u}(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\dot{u}(t) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} (u(t)) \\right)^{-1} \\left( r(t) - g(u(t)) \\right)\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\nThis formulation results in an integrator with a variable gain (the inverse Jacobian) and guarantees asymptotic tracking for a constant reference signal \\(r(t)\\).\n\nIncorporating the Speedup Factor\nFor a time-dependent reference signal \\(r(t)\\), the controller’s action is “sped up” (note this is technically not a ‘gain’) by multiplying the Right-Hand Side (RHS) of Equation (2) by a constant \\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\). This results in the standard NRF tracking controller:\n\\[\n\\dot{u}(t) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} (u(t)) \\right)^{-1} \\left( r(t) - g(u(t)) \\right)\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\nThe controller speedup factor (\\(\\alpha\\)) serves to potentially stabilize the closed-loop system and reduce the asymptotic tracking error, providing a tighter upper bound on the error, \\(\\eta/\\alpha\\), where \\(\\eta\\) relates to the rate of change of the reference."

    "text": "The Enhanced Controller and Practical Performance\nThe controller defined by Equation (5) is often referred to as the earlier version of the NRF tracking technique, where only approximate tracking was obtained in initial published works. A later, enhanced controller (modified control algorithm) was derived, which provides a stronger theoretical guarantee: it ensures exact asymptotic tracking of \\(r(t+T)\\) by \\(\\hat{y}(t+T)\\) without resorting to controller speedup (\\(\\alpha=1\\)).\nThis enhanced controller (Equation 20 in the source) achieves this by adding terms that include the time derivative of the reference signal \\(\\dot{r}(t+T)\\) and related system dynamics terms to the controller rate equation:\n\\[\n\\dot{u}(t) = - \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial u} (x(t), u(t)) \\right)^{-1} \\left( r(t+ T ) - \\hat{y}(t+ T ) + \\dot{r}(t+ T ) - \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} (x(t), u(t))f(x(t), u(t)) \\right)\n\\tag{7}\n\\]\nFor this modified controller (Equation 7), the Lyapunov function derivative satisfies \\(\\dot{V} = -2V\\), guaranteeing that the error \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (r(t) - \\hat{y}(t))\\) converges exactly to zero.\nNote that this means that the predictor model should track the reference, not your actual system! Actual tracking performance is bounded by the accuracy of your predictor function. As the engineer implementing this method, you can choose any prediction method, as long as its jacobian with respect to the input can be calculated and is invertible.\n\nSimplicity vs. Perfection\nDespite the enhanced controller offering this guarantee of exact asymptotic convergence (Equation 7), the standard controller (Equation 5) still has a significant place because it is simpler and does not require computing reference trajectory derivatives. It can be more practical in many situations when compute and time do not allow.\nFurthermore, the standard NRF controller demonstrates excellent real-world performance even without the guarantee of exact tracking [2]. For instance, when applied to aggressive quadrotor flight, the standard NRF controller achieved good tracking and outperformed the native, highly-tuned PID controller in the PX4 autopilot stack across all tested trajectories. This strong performance is achieved even when using a highly simplified predictor based on linearized dynamics, which emphasizes that the power of the NRF method lies in the combination of the flow equation and a reasonable, though not necessarily perfect, predictor."
